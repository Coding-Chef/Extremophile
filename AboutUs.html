			<h2 id="ownerHead">About the owner</h2>
			
			<p>Originally opened in 1986 by Ian Grochevki as a simple bike store he quickly realised the potential for growth into the ever popular snow sports genre<br>
			 and grew to be the biggest seller of bike and snow gear within his first 2 years of operation.<br>
			 <br>
			 In the summer of 2008 the store he was located in was burnt to ashes under suspicious circumstances. With a plan to expand into the world of Extreme sports he quickly reopened under the new name "Extremophile<sup>1</sup>". <br>
			 Since then the store has quickly become one of the biggest suppliers of all things extreme<br>
			 including but not limited to, skateboarding, downhill mountainbiking, base jumping gear and of course all the winter gear you'll need to stay warm and enjoy the slopes.</p>
			
			<aside>
				<h2 id="theFire">The fire</h2>
				<p>Although the police could never prove anything it is believed the fire that burned down Ian Grochevki's first store was started by a local gang that was hired by a nearby competitor.</p>
